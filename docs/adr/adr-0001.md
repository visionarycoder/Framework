# ADR-0001: Establish Solution Architect Radar and Best Practice Capsules

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-10-04

## Context

As a solution architect, we need a structured way to:

- Track industry best practices across multiple specialties.
- Provide clear guidance to developers and collaborators.
- Ensure decisions are documented, discoverable, and reproducible.
- Align Copilot instructions, repo hygiene, and onboarding with architectural standards.

Without a consistent framework, knowledge becomes siloed, onboarding is inconsistent, and architectural drift increases over time.

## Decision

We will implement a **Living Architecture Playbook** in this repository, consisting of:

- **Solution Architect Radar** (`/best-practices/radar.md`) to track maturity of practices (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold).
- **Best Practice Capsules** (`/best-practices/{specialty}/readme.md`) for modular, specialty-specific guidance.
- **Copilot instruction files** (`/.copilot/`) to align AI-generated outputs with repo standards.
- **ADRs** (`/docs/architecture-decision-records/`) to capture context-specific architectural decisions.

This structure ensures:

- Knowledge is modular, discoverable, and version-controlled.
- Practices evolve with industry trends while maintaining clarity.
- Copilot and contributors follow the same standards.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:

  - Improves onboarding and collaboration.
  - Provides a single source of truth for best practices.
  - Reduces architectural drift and knowledge silos.
  - Enables iterative updates as practices evolve.

- **Negative**:

  - Requires ongoing curation and quarterly updates to the radar.
  - Adds initial overhead in setting up and maintaining capsules.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Ad-hoc documentation** in wiki or Confluence → rejected due to lack of version control and discoverability.
- **One large architecture guide** → rejected due to poor modularity and difficulty in updating.
- **Tool-specific standards only** → rejected because solution architecture spans multiple specialties.
